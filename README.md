# Yermaw's Lockout Sharing

I am sharing some raid & dungeon lockouts in World of Warcraft retail, allowing you to skip directly to the boss who drops the mount or transmog item!

## Instructions

Stand directly outside the instance you want to skip, and send me the below message from the in-game chat window:

`/w Yermaw-Bronzebeard !sharing`

Accept my group invite, then go inside the instance.

Whisper me + if you are finished, or whisper me ++ if you would like to invite some others to the group - you will be made group leader, the best way to invite friends from this point is to list a group in the LFG tool. My WeakAura will detect this and automatically leave the group once listed.

## Alliance characters, or Horde getting "No player named Yermaw is currently online."

Join the in-game community to work around this. The current invite code is always in my status posts on Discord.

## FAQs

Are you a bot? No, a WeakAura does the messaging and inviting for me (this is what a bot would say...).  
Can you share Dragon Soul/Mogu'shan Vault/ToT/SoO[M]/BFA dungeons - Unfortunately not, due to Blizzard limitations.  
What do you get from doing this? - Heart reacts on Discord mostly. I do love getting messages when people get drops from my shares though.
