# Yermaw's Lockout Sharing

I am sharing some raid & dungeon lockouts in World of Warcraft retail, allowing you to skip directly to the boss who drops the mount or transmog item!

## Instructions

Stand directly outside the instance you want to skip, and send me the below message from the in-game chat window:

`/w Yermaw-Bronzebeard !sharing`

Accept my group invite, then go inside the instance. I will automatically pass lead and leave the group when you go inside.

If you want to invite friends, you can either suggest I invite them to the group (automatically accepted), or send me `!lead` before you enter to be automatically passed lead when you enter.  

## Commands
`!normal` or `!nm` - Set raid difficulty to Normal (Default Setting), send this *before* you enter.  
`!heroic` or `!hc` - Set raid difficulty to Heroic, send this *before* you enter.  
`!lead` - Send this to get promoted to leader so you can invite others or create a group in LFG, send this *before* you enter.  

## Alliance characters, or Horde getting "No player named Yermaw is currently online."

Join the in-game community to work around this. The current invite code is always in my status posts on Discord (see FAQs below).

Step 1: Set Raid Difficulty to Heroic and 25 Player, Enter ICC, Kill the first boss (Lord Marrowgar), Exit ICC

`/w Yermaw-Bronzebeard !sharing`  
Accept the invite  
Step 3: Enter ICC, Accept the lockout, Use Teleporter to Upper Spire, Kill Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Use Teleport to Light's Hammer, Exit ICC (this is important, if you go straight to Lich King here, it'll still be on Normal)  
Step 4: Enter ICC, Use Teleporter to Upper Spire, Go to the centre of The Spire to teleport to Lich King, Kill Lich King  
Step 5: (optional) Loot Invincible's Reins  

## FAQs

When are you online? I post to the following Discord server when I am online - https://discord.gg/achievements (#eu-chat-and-lfg channel)  
Are you a bot? No, an addon does the messaging and inviting for me (this is what a bot would say...).  
Can you share Dragon Soul/Mogu'shan Vault/ToT/SoO[M]/BFA dungeons - Unfortunately not, due to Blizzard limitations.  
What do you get from doing this? - Heart reacts on Discord mostly. I do love getting messages when people get drops from my shares though.
